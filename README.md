# Cinemagic
This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on an underlying recommendation algorithm encapsulated within the system. The system operates on a database of users and a database of movies, where each user has a set of movie preferences and each movie has a set of attributes.

## Program Structure
The system is organized into the following classes, each of which corresponds to a source (`*.cpp`) and header (`*.h`) file pair:
- `User`: This class models a user in the system. It stores user attributes such as their email, name, and movie preferences.
- `Movie`: This class models a movie in the system. It stores movie attributes such as its title, release year, genre, and rating.
- `UserDatabase`: This class is a container for `User` objects. It provides functionalities to load user data from a file, retrieve a user by their email, and other user-related operations.
- `MovieDatabase`: Similar to `UserDatabase`, this class is a container for `Movie` objects and provides functionalities to load movie data from a file, retrieve a movie by its ID, and other movie-related operations.
- `Recommender`: This class encapsulates the recommendation algorithm of the system. It uses the `UserDatabase` and `MovieDatabase` to provide movie recommendations for a given user.
- `TreeMultimap`: This class is a generic template that provides a mapping between keys and multiple values. It could be used to map a user to multiple movies or vice versa.

The `main.cpp` file is the entry point of the system. It initializes the `UserDatabase` and `MovieDatabase` with data from `users.txt` and `movies.txt` files, respectively, and uses the `Recommender` class to suggest movies to a given user.

## Files
Below is a list of all the files in the project:
1. `User.h` and `User.cpp`
2. `Movie.h` and `Movie.cpp`
3. `UserDatabase.h` and `UserDatabase.cpp`
4. `MovieDatabase.h` and `MovieDatabase.cpp`
5. `Recommender.h` and `Recommender.cpp`
6. `main.cpp`
7. `users.txt`
8. `movies.txt`
9. `treemm.h`
    
## How to Run
Compile all the `*.cpp` files together. The entry point is `main.cpp`. Make sure that the `users.txt` and `movies.txt` files are in the same directory as the compiled executable.

Once compiled, you can run the executable, and the system will start by loading user data and movie data, and it will then generate movie recommendations for a given user.

Enjoy exploring the recommendations!

## Future Work
The current state of the project leaves room for a few enhancements:
- Implement user interactivity for inputting the user email.
- Extend the program to ask users for their preferences, update the preferences, and provide new recommendations based on updated data.
- Implement a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, you will need a C++ compiler that supports at least the C++11 standard. For the purpose of this instruction, we will be using g++, a widely used C++ compiler that comes with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

## Compilation
To compile all the `.cpp` files together, navigate to the directory containing the source code files and run the following command:
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o Cinemagic main.cpp User.cpp UserDatabase.cpp Movie.cpp MovieDatabase.cpp Recommender.cpp
```
This command compiles all the `.cpp` files and creates an executable named `Cinemagic`.

Note: The `-std=c++11` option is used to specify that the C++11 standard should be used for compilation.

## Execution
To run the `Cinemagic` executable, use the following command:
```
./Cinemagic
```
